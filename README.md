# Group-6-Section-A-Blockchain-Project
Problem Statement: Gambling in the sports industry has been there since a very long time and has seen an immense growth in the recent years and is also expected to grow. Various bookmakers around the world help bettors on an everyday basis. With all these increased transactions, the pressure to maintain perfection in execution is huge. There are several disadvantages in the traditional betting system like an altered or mistakenly entered data resulting in incorrect resolutions, delayed deposits and withdrawals due to old-fashioned systems, etc. A blockchain based book can help in better protection and provide high-end security in these scenarios with the help of smart contracts which ensure that transactions occur as they are intended to. Also, in a traditional transaction, the data flows through data providers, agents, regulatory bodies and operators. Decentralization of data using blockchain helps in making the data publicly shared but also facilitates a streamlined flow of data.

Approach: The bettors will visit the online platform to register their bets on the team they would like to. After this, their bets would be treated like a transaction and are properly registered in a chain that is shared among all the players thereby making the data publicly shared. Each bettor would have their own copy of all the bets placed which would reduce the possibility of cheating or somebody changing their results randomly.

Result: The outcome of the project would help in reduction of middle-men, cheating, tampering of records, delayed deposits & withdrawals, etc. And in turn it would help in streamlined, instantaneous, protected and error-free transactions. Any e-wallet or Bank would not be able to cancel your betting deposit and on the other hand the miners authenticate the transactions so they cannot scrutinize the type of the transaction.
